# Building an Army

---

## Unit Selection

When building an army for Halo: Breakpoint you choose units from the provided army lists, adding up the points for the models, their weapons, and equipment.

There are 3 types of unit available to add to your army: Standard, Specialist and Vehicles. Your army must contain at least 50% Standard units by points, and no more than 50% Specialist units. Vehicles count as Specialist units and are only used in games of 400 or more points (unless players agree to use them).

## Game Size

- Small games are played with armies up to 200 points.
- Standard games are played with armies up to 300 points.
- Larger games can be played at 400 and 500 points but these typically require a much larger battlefield.

## Reinforcements

For more sustained battles players can choose to add 100 points of reinforcements, additional units of any kind which become available from the start of round 3 to be deployed from reserve. The rules for unit selection apply to the total combined army and you may choose which models up to 100 points are reinforcements.

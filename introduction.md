# Halo: Breakpoint

---

Halo: Breakpoint is a fan made game set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline using 28mm miniatures. As there are no official miniatures in this scale you will need to find suitable proxies, or fan made sculpts to use.

You will need the [Cadence Core Rules](../core-rules/introduction.md) to play this game. 

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

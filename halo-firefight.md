# Halo Firefight

Halo Firefight is a fan made game module set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline. Halo Firefight uses the Cadence Wargame System core rules, which can be found at [Cadence.Games](https://cadence.games).

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Module Rules

### Playing Halo Firefight

Halo Firefight is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm, individually based miniatures.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Model Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------ | :----- |
| Active Camo | When a model targets this model for an attack from more than 6 inches away, it must roll a d6 first. On a roll of a 6 it is able to make the attack. All attacks against this model suffer -1 to their Attack Rolls. If this model is hit by any attacks it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Transport (X) | This model may carry X models. A unit within 1 inch of this model, with X or fewer models in it, may perform an Embark Action (1 Command Point). Remove the unit from the board and place it into reserve as they are now being transported by this model. Any unit may be deployed from reserve using the Transport as its Entry Point - however they must be placed within 1 inch of the Transport model.
| Weak Point (Arc) | This model counts as having a Toughness of 1 against attacks in the specified Arc. |
| Vehicle | This model may not use climbable terrain. In addition this model may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Barrage | This weapon may split its attacks between two targets, so long as they are both valid targets, and are within 3 inches of each other. Decide how many of the attacks are targeting each of the targets before making any Attack Rolls. |
| Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round. |
| Dual Wield (X) | If a model is equipped with two of these weapons it may add X to the Attacks attribute. |

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Playing Halo Breakpoint 

Halo: Breakpoint is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and some small vehicles.

### Vehicles

Models with the "Vehicle" special rule have the following changes to their rules:

Vehicles ignore the climbable keyword for terrain, treating them as impassable instead.

In addition these models may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Model Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------ | :----- |
| Active Camo | Attacks against this model have -1 to their Attack Roll and an additional -1 for every full 6 inches of distance between the attacker and target. If this model is hit by any attacks, makes any attack, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Grenade | Only 1 model in a unit may use a weapon with this rule per Attack Action. |
| Officer | Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Split Fire | This weapon may split its attacks between two targets, so long as they are both valid targets, and are within 3 inches of each other. Decide how many of the attacks are targeting each of the targets before making any Attack Rolls. |
| Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round. |

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Playing Halo Breakpoint 

Halo: Breakpoint is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and some small vehicles.

### Vehicles

Models with the "Vehicle" special rule have the following changes to their rules:

- Vehicles ignore the climbable keyword for terrain, treating them as impassable instead.
- Vehicles may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Model Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------ | :----- |
| Active Camo | Attacks against this model have -1 to their Attack Roll and an additional -1 for every full 6 inches of distance between the attacker and target. If this model is hit by any attacks, makes any attack, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Grenade | Only 1 model in a unit may use a weapon with this rule per Attack Action. |
| Officer | Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Split Fire | This weapon may split its attacks between two targets, so long as they are both valid targets, and are within 3 inches of each other. Decide how many of the attacks are targeting each of the targets before making any Attack Rolls. |
| Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round. |

## Missions

### Objective Locations

Each player will determine their own objectives for each encounter, each of which will be located at one of 9 spots on the battlefield. These spots are always determined by the players assigned table edge. The 9 spots are:

- The center of the battlefield
- The midpoint between the center and each of the 4 corners of the battlefield
- The midpoint between the center and the center of each table edge

The 9 spots are labeld A-I as shown below:

### Setting Up Terrain

### Primary Player

Players should roll-off, with the winner being declared the Primary Player. The Primary Player chooses one of the table edges with the other player taking the opposite edge. They may either choose or randomly determine their primary objective.

### Primary Objectives

The Primary Player declares their Primary Objective: Recover, Control, or Sabotage. The other player may then choose to contest the primary objective or select one of the other primary objectives.

#### Recover

The Recover objective is placed at positions A, B, or C. If the second player chose to contest the objective it is placed at either D, E, or F.

#### Control

Control objectives are placed in a line either A-E-I, B-E-H, D-E-F, or G-E-C. If the second player chose to contest one single objective is placed at E.

#### Sabotage

Sabotage objectives are placed at A, C, G, and I. If the second player chose to contest an additional objective is placed at E.

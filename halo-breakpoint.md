> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Playing Halo Breakpoint 

Halo: Breakpoint is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and may include vehicles.

A game of Halo: Breakpoint lasts for 6 rounds.

### Vehicles

Models with the "Vehicle" special rule have the following changes to their rules:

- Vehicles ignore the climbable keyword for terrain, treating them as impassable instead.
- Vehicles count as having the "Non-scoring" special rule.
- Vehicles may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

Model Special Rules | Effect |
:------------------ | :----- |
Active Camo | Attacks against this model have -1 to their Attack Roll and an additional -1 for every full 6 inches of distance between the attacker and target. If this model is hit by any attacks, makes any attack, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round.
Grenade | Only 1 model in a unit may use a weapon with this rule per Attack Action.
Officer | Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test. Units with the Panic special rule may re-roll their panic test if they are within 6 inches of a friendly unit with this special rule.
Jetpack | This model counts as having the Flying special rule and gains +2 to their Movement attribute when making an Advance action.
Panic | Any time this unit loses a model to an attack it must roll a d6. On a roll of a 1 it loses a Command Point.
Weak Spot | Against attacks which originate in this models rear arc this model has -2 to its Defence Rolls and Counter Rolls.

Weapon Special Rules | Effect
:------------------- | :-----
Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round.

## Building an Army

When building an army for Halo: Breakpoint you choose units from the provided army lists, adding up the points for the models, their weapons, and equipment. Games are usually played around 300 points per player - if you wish to play larger games you may require a larger battlefield.

There are 2 types of unit available to add to your army: Standard and Specialist. Your army must contain at least 50% Standard units by points, and no more than 50% Specialist units.

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Playing Halo Breakpoint 

Halo: Breakpoint is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and some small vehicles.

### Vehicles

Models with the "Vehicle" special rule have the following changes to their rules:

Vehicles ignore the climbable keyword for terrain. In addition these models may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon.

#### Action: Embark (1 Command Point)

A unit may perform this action while within 1 inch of a transport vehicle with sufficient capacity for the whole unit. Remove the unit from the board and place it into reserve as they are now being transported by this model.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Model Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------ | :----- |
| Active Camo | This model cannot be targeted by attacks from more than 12 inches away. If this model is hit by any attacks, makes and attack, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Grenade | Only 1 model in a unit may use a weapon with this rule per Attack Action. |
| Officer | Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test. |
| Panic | When this unit loses a model it must roll a d6, on a roll of 3+ the unit does nothing, otherwise the unit panics and loses a Command Point. This unit ignores this rule if it is within 6 inches of a friendly Elite or Brute unit. |
| Weak Point (Arc) | This model counts as having a Toughness of 1 against attacks in the specified Arc. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Split Fire | This weapon may split its attacks between two targets, so long as they are both valid targets, and are within 3 inches of each other. Decide how many of the attacks are targeting each of the targets before making any Attack Rolls. |
| Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round. |
| Dual Wield (X) | If a model is equipped with two of these weapons it may add X to the Attacks attribute. |

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Playing Halo Breakpoint 

Halo: Breakpoint is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and some small vehicles.

A game of Halo: Breakpoint lasts for 6 rounds.

### Vehicles

Models with the "Vehicle" special rule have the following changes to their rules:

- Vehicles ignore the climbable keyword for terrain, treating them as impassable instead.
- Vehicles may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Model Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------ | :----- |
| Active Camo | Attacks against this model have -1 to their Attack Roll and an additional -1 for every full 6 inches of distance between the attacker and target. If this model is hit by any attacks, makes any attack, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Grenade | Only 1 model in a unit may use a weapon with this rule per Attack Action. |
| Officer | Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Split Fire | This weapon may split its attacks between two targets, so long as they are both valid targets, and are within 3 inches of each other. Decide how many of the attacks are targeting each of the targets before making any Attack Rolls. |
| Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round. |

## Building an Army

### Formations

When you construct your army you choose units from one of the army lists, adding up the points for each model, their weapons, and equipment. You may take up to 300 points of units and equipment, these units are called a formation. A small game of Halo: Breakpoint sees both players taking just a single formation, with a medium size game having two, and a larger game using three.

When you make your formation you may not go over the 300 points limit, if you cannot make the formation exactly 300 points these unspent points are not used in another formation.

## Missions

Missions in Halo: Breakpoint are created by each player choosing their main objective, the nature of the encounter, and any complications. Before following this process you should set up your battlefield with a good mix of terrain.

Each player will determine their own objectives for each encounter, each of which will be located near one of 9 spots on the battlefield. These spots are always determined by the player in questions assigned table edge. The 9 spots are:

- 1 at he center of the battlefield.
- 4 at the midpoints between the center and each of the 4 corners of the battlefield.
- 4 at the midpoints between the center and the center of each table edge

The 9 spots are labeld A-I as shown below:

### Step 1 - Primary and Secondary Player

The first step in setting up your mission is to determine who the primary and secondary player is, players roll-off and the winner can chooses which they want to be. The primary player chooses one of the table edges, this can be either a long or short table edge. The secondary player takes the opposite edge. 

### Step 2 - Determine Main Objectives

The primary player declares their main objective as one of the following: Recovery, Territory Control, or Sabotage. The secondary player may then choose to contest the primary objective or select one of the other primary objectives. This choice will determine the position and type of objective markers that will be placed.

Each objective marker can be placed by the player that chose the main objective up to 3 inches from the indicated spot. If the main objective is contested the players use the same objective markers, if the players choose different main objectives they each place their objectives separately and may not be overlapping. Objectives may only be secured by a player if they chose them as their main objective.

#### Main Objective: Recovery

A single recover objective is placed at position A, B, or C. If the second player chose to contest the objective it is placed at either D, E, or F. If the unit that secured the objective is destroyed, place a marker in base contact with the last model in the unit before it is removed. This objective may be secured by another unit from this point.

This objective is worth 15 Victory Points if it is secured at the end of round 6.

#### Main Objective: Territory Control

Control objectives are placed in a line either A-E-I, B-E-H, D-E-F, or G-E-C. If the second player chose to contest one single control objective is placed at E and then each player may place another control objective at any other unused spot, starting with the main player.

Each control objective is worth 1 Victory Point if it secured at the end of the round, starting from round 2. Each control objective is worth an additional 1 Victory Point if they are secured at the end of round 6.

#### Sabotage

Access objectives are placed at A, C, G, and I. If the second player chose to contest an additional destroy objective is placed at E.

Access objectives are worth 4 Victory Points when secured.

### Step 3 - Encounter Type

The primary player should roll a d6 to determine the encounter type and consult the encounter table below. The encounter type represents how the players force has approached the battle - dropping right into the battle from the air, dug in to defend their position, or encountering resistance on a standard patrol.

| Result | Primary Player | Secondary Player |
| :----: | :------------- | :--------------- |
| 1      | Assault        | Defence          |
| 2      | Assault        | Patrol           |
| 3      | Defence        | Assault          |
| 4      | Defence        | Patrol           |
| 5      | Patrol         | Assault          |
| 6      | Patrol         | Defence          | 

#### Encounter - Assault

This player may place 3 entry points anywhere up to 6 inches from their table edge. During round 1 only units from one of this players formations can be deployed from reserve - the player can choose which formation. All remaining units will be available to deploy from the start of round 2.

#### Encounter - Defence

This player does not place any entry points but instead must place all of their units on the battlefield, within 9 inches of their table edge, before the battle begins.

#### Encounter - Patrol

This player may place 1 entry point anywhere on their table edge. All of their units are available from the start of round 1 but may not make an advance action on their first activation.

### Step 4 - Complications

Battlefield conditions are not always ideal, the primary player should roll a d6 before the game begins. On a roll of a 1 the conditions will be less than ideal - roll a d3:

| Result | Complication | Effect |
| :----: | :----------- | :----- |
| 1      | Night Battle | Attacks targeting models more than 12 inches away suffer a -1 modifier unless the |
| 2      | Landing Zone is Hot | Affects deployment from reserve |
| 3      | Bad Intel | Affects objectives |

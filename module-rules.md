## Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Model Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------ | :----- |
| Active Camo | Attacks against this model have -1 to their Attack Roll and an additional -1 for every full 12 inches of distance between the attacker and target. If this model is hit by any attacks, takes an attack action, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Officer | Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test. Units with the Panic special rule may re-roll their panic test if they are within 6 inches of a friendly unit with this special rule. |
| Jetpack | This model counts as having the Flying special rule and gains +3 to their Movement attribute when making an Advance action. |
| Panic | Any time this unit loses a model to an attack it must roll a d6. On a roll of a 1 it loses a Command Point. |
| Valuable Asset (X) | Killing a model with this Special rule awards X Victory Points. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Deployable | This weapon cannot be used if the unit has performed a Move action this round. If this weapon is used, the unit cannot make a Move action this round. |
| Plasma | The Shields special rule does not apply against attacks against weapons with this rule. |
